Final Recommendations
Best Configuration: The 3-layer model with 128 or 256 units per layer consistently provides the best balance of coherence and stylistic relevance. Specifically:
•	128 Units yields coherent text with stylistic fidelity and meaningful context.
•	256 Units offers higher complexity, with creative but occasionally fragmented text.
Optimal Temperature:
•	0.5 provides a balance between creativity and coherence, generating meaningful sentences with stylistic depth.
•	0.1 produces safer but simpler sentences, useful for consistent but less creative text.
Prompts:
•	The model responds well to Shakespearean prompts, especially with 3 layers and 128 or 256 units, capturing stylistic elements and vocabulary.
This configuration best supports your goal of generating text with coherence and stylistic accuracy reflective of Shakespearean language.
